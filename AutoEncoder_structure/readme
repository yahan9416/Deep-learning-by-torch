In this file folder, always use the auto-encoder structure and in this structure each layer is a convolution nueral neetwork or a deconvolution.
In the neural network,divide into convolution part and maxpool part. 

In the convolution part :
   inputsize**input_channel
   the output size = [input_size-(kernel_size - stride)]
   output size * output_channel
   
In the maxpool part:
   inputsize**input_channel
   the output size = [inputsize-(kernel_szie-stride)]/stride
   output size * output_channel
   
Deconvolution  part :
  first is unmaxpool and then is unconvolution. the parameter(including kernel_size,stride) is same to convolution 

The nor_loss_mse_withstd.py file is used to predict gene essential score by the normalized crispr data and use “mse( (aa - mean_c(aa))/sd(aa)  , (pred - mean_c(pred))/sd(pred))” 
as the loss value calculated method.

The nor_loss_mse_without_std.py file is used to predict gene essential score by the normalized crispr data and use “mse( (aa - mean_c(aa)), (pred - mean_c(pred))” 
as the loss value calculated method.

The nor_loss_pearson.py file is used to predict gene essential score by the normalized crispr data and use “1-pearson correlation(aa)” 
as the loss value calculated method.
